##Speech Corpus for Cross-Lingual Prosody Transfer

This is a multilingual speech corpus containing prosodically rich sentences designed for research in the domain of cross-lingual prosody transfer in the context of expressive speech synthesis. The corpus has been created within the research project "SP2: SCOPES Project on Speech Prosody" supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation. 

##Contents

The corpus contains recordings of 50 pairs of sentences comprising a sentence with predetermined emphasis and one without. The sentences are divided in 5 groups according to the type of emphasis:
    A. Emphasis on one word
    B. Emphasis early on in the sentence
    C. Contrastive emphasis
    D. Contrastive emphasis in a question
    E. Emphasis as a result of a semantic focus on a relatively large constituent


In the initial commit there are recordings from 8 speakers in 6 languages: English, French, German, Hungarian, Serbian, and Macedonian. Contributions are welcome.
